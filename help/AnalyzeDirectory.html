Analyzes the files in a directory, looking for archives and previewable file types. This is most useful to someone wanting to get an overview of a whole game at once, or someone who wants to generate a list of all files in a game.
<br><br>
There are several checkboxes that allow you to choose how detailed you want the analysis:
<br /><br />
<table class="width100">
  <tr class="width100">
    <td><img src="images/bullet.png" /></td><td class="width100"><i>Analyze Sub-Directories:</i> When ticked, the current directory will be analyzed, as well as all sub-directories within it. When unticked, only the current directory is analyzed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="width100">
    <td><img src="images/bullet.png" /></td><td class="width100"><i>Identify Previewable Formats:</i> When ticked, the analysis looks for archives as well as other files that can be previewed by Game Extractor, such as images and audio files. When unticked, only archives are identified.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="width100">
    <td><img src="images/bullet.png" /></td><td class="width100"><i>Identify Formats within Archives:</i> When ticked, all the files in an archive are analyzed, looking for any that can be previewed by Game Extractor. When unticked, the files in an archive are listed, but not whether they can be previewed or not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="width100">
    <td><img src="images/bullet.png" /></td><td class="width100"><i>Extract all Files from Archives:</i> When ticked, the files are extracted from all archives that are found. Files are also converted into a different format, if chosen. When unticked, files are only extracted if required for some of the other analysis options chosen.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br />
At the bottom, you can optionally choose a format for image and model conversions. If you have the <i>Extract All Files</i> checkbox ticked, all images and models that are found in archives will also be converted into these formats.
<br /><br />
You also choose a format for the generated analysis report, and enter a report filename. The report provides a list of all identified archives, and other information depending on the checkboxes that were chosen.
<br /><br />
The analysis report, as well as all files extracted (and optionally converted) are saved to the Analysis directory specified in the <a href="Options.html" class="italic green">Options</a>. To conserve disk space, if there are files in this directory when you close Game Extractor, you will be asked whether Game Extractor should remove them or not.
